# Sub-Set-Problem
In this presentation, Subset Sum problem (Non Polynomial Complete problem) and analysis of its two solutions is discussed. These solutions are the Dynamic Solution algorithm and the Back Tracking algorithm. Dynamic Solution is a sound and complete algorithm that can be used to determine satisfiability and unsatisfiability with certainty. Backtracking also finds the satisfiability but will have a time complexity of exponential degree. In addition, analogy between these two algorithms and two other algorithms namely PL-Resolution and Walk-Sat algorithms for 3-CNF SAT problem, which is also NPC problem is discussed.
